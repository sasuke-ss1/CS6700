# Assignment 3

This assignment's main goal is to analyze two different variants of doing heirarichical reinforcement learning, namely SMDP and IOQL. We also experiment with different options.


## Training

The folloing codes can be used to train SMDP and IOQL with normal options respectively.

```sh
python SMDP.py
```

```sh
python IOQL.py
```


The folloing codes can be used to train SMDP and IOQL with alternative options respectively.

```sh
python SMDP2.py
```

```sh
python IOQL2.py
```


One can change the hyperparameters using python command line arguments. The list of all the hyper prarmeters can be found using the following command.

```sh
python <filename.py> --help
```
